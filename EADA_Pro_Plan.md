# EADA Pro - Project Plan

## 1. Vision
To build an intelligent, privacy-preserving adaptive workspace assistant that optimizes accessibility, ergonomics, and productivity through real-time AI.

## 2. Objectives
- Adaptive control of display brightness, volume, and media.
- Real-time posture and gesture recognition.
- Edge-first, privacy-preserving deployment.
- Multi-modal control (gesture + voice).
- Scalable enterprise and IoT integration.
- **Public Display Optimization:** Crowd-aware content adaptation for TVs and billboards.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Smart power management for outdoor displays.
- **Security Features:** Unusual behavior detection and emergency response.
- **Environmental Adaptation:** Brightness adjustment based on ambient lighting (dark/sunlight).
- **Audio Environment Awareness:** Volume adjustment based on background music levels.

## 3. Development Phases
| Phase | Focus | Key Deliverables |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| Phase 1 | Core functionality | Distance detection, adaptive brightness/volume, presence-based media control |
| Phase 2 | Gesture integration | Hand detection, gesture-to-action mapping, smooth adaptation |
| Phase 3 | API + Dashboard | FastAPI backend, live metrics endpoint, React dashboard with face counting display |
| Phase 4 | Industry expansion | AES profile encryption, edge deployment, enterprise analytics |
| Phase 5 | Public Display Features | Crowd size detection, weather adaptation, energy optimization, weighted face-based adaptation |
| Phase 6 | Security & Analytics | Behavior monitoring, emergency detection, advertising effectiveness metrics |

## 4. Tools & Stack
