# EADA Pro - Implementation Tasks

## Phase 1: Core Perception & Adaptation
- [ ] Set up webcam + audio capture.
- [ ] Implement face detection (MediaPipe FaceMesh).
- [ ] Calculate user distance using face width triangulation.
- [ ] Adapt brightness & volume based on distance.
- [ ] Add presence detection (auto pause/resume).
- [ ] Create console-based metrics log.

## Phase 2: Gesture Integration ✅
- [x] Integrate MediaPipe Hands module.
- [x] Define gesture mappings:
  - Thumb–index distance → Volume control
  - Wrist Y-axis → Brightness control
  - Open palm → Play/pause
- [x] Add gesture smoothing & stability checks.
- [x] Display live gesture detection feedback.
- [x] Implement gesture priority override system.
- [x] Add custom gesture framework documentation.

## Phase 3: API + Dashboard
- [ ] Build FastAPI service (`main.py`).
- [ ] Endpoints: `/metrics/live`, `/metrics/history`.
- [ ] Add WebSocket for live streaming.
- [ ] Create React dashboard to visualize metrics.
- [ ] **Add real-time face count display to dashboard.**
- [ ] **Implement weighted adaptation visualization (volume/brightness indicators).**
- [ ] Implement SQLite logging.

## Phase 4: Industry-Level Enhancements
- [ ] AES-256 encryption for profiles.
- [ ] Voice command (Whisper/Vosk).
- [ ] Enterprise analytics (ergonomic trends).
- [ ] Edge deployment via Synaptics Astra SDK.
- [ ] Cloud sync for aggregated insights.

## Phase 5: Public Display Features
- [ ] Implement YOLO-based crowd counting.
- [ ] Add weather API integration for environmental adaptation.
- [ ] Create energy management system for power optimization.
- [ ] Develop content adaptation based on audience demographics.
- [ ] Add multi-display coordination capabilities.
- [ ] Implement ambient light detection using camera sensors.
- [ ] Add background music analysis for volume adjustment.
- [ ] Create environmental adaptation algorithms for brightness/volume.
- [ ] **Implement real-time face counting with MediaPipe Face Detection.**
- [ ] **Develop weighted adaptation algorithm (closer faces = higher weight for volume/brightness).**
- [ ] **Add face position tracking for spatial weighting (center vs. edges).**

## Phase 6: Security & Analytics
- [ ] Implement behavior anomaly detection.
- [ ] Add emergency gesture recognition (help signals).
- [ ] Create advertising effectiveness analytics.
- [ ] Develop security alert system integration.
- [ ] Build comprehensive analytics dashboard for public displays.
