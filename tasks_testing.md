# EADA Pro - Testing Plan

## 1. Perception Layer
- [x] Validate face detection across lighting conditions.
- [x] Test distance accuracy within ±10 cm.
- [x] Two-stage face detection for long-range (100cm+).
- [ ] Confirm gesture recognition latency <200 ms.
- [ ] Test gesture smoothing effectiveness.
- [ ] Validate hand tracking accuracy in various poses.

## 2. Intelligence Layer
- [x] Check correct volume mapping per 0.05 m distance change.
- [x] Verify brightness interpolation and no jitter.
- [x] Confirm correct play/pause behavior after 3 s absence.
- [x] Validate stability logic (1.5s wait, 5cm grace range).
- [ ] Test gesture-based volume control accuracy.
- [ ] Test gesture-based brightness control accuracy.
- [ ] Verify gesture priority override system.
- [ ] Validate play/pause gesture recognition.

## 3. Adaptation Layer
- [ ] Test smooth response (2 % change threshold).
- [ ] Simulate random noise; ensure stability.
- [ ] Validate response consistency at 30 FPS.

## 4. API & Dashboard
- [ ] `/metrics/live` returns valid JSON in <50 ms.
- [ ] WebSocket updates real-time metrics (1 Hz).
- [ ] Dashboard graphs update dynamically.
- [ ] **Face count display updates in real-time (<100ms latency).**
- [ ] **Weighted adaptation indicators show correct volume/brightness levels.**

## 5. Security
- [ ] AES encryption/decryption functional.
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed in logs.

## 6. Public Display Testing
- [ ] Crowd counting accuracy within ±15% across various lighting conditions.
- [ ] Weather adaptation response time <30 seconds.
- [ ] Energy savings >40% during low-traffic periods.
- [ ] Content adaptation based on demographic detection.
- [ ] Multi-display synchronization within 100ms.
- [ ] Ambient light detection accuracy within ±20% illuminance.
- [ ] Background music volume adjustment maintains optimal 15-20dB S/N ratio.
- [ ] Environmental adaptation response time <5 seconds.
- [ ] **Face counting accuracy >95% (1-10 faces, various angles/positions).**
- [ ] **Weighted adaptation: closer faces contribute 2x more to volume/brightness than distant faces.**
- [ ] **Spatial weighting: center faces have 1.5x weight vs. edge faces.**

## 7. Security & Emergency Features
- [ ] Anomaly detection accuracy >85% for unusual behavior.
- [ ] Emergency gesture recognition response time <2 seconds.
- [ ] Security alert integration with external systems.
- [ ] Privacy-preserving processing (no identifiable data storage).
