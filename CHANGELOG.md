# EADA Pro - Changelog

## Gesture Control Refinement (October 25, 2025)

### ðŸŽ® Improved Gesture Responsiveness & Control

#### Gesture Behavior Changes
- **Changed from Override to Blended Control**
  - Gestures now adjust rather than override distance-based control
  - Blend ratio: 70% distance-based + 30% gesture adjustment
  - Distance-based control always remains active
  - Provides smooth fine-tuning on top of automatic adaptation

- **Reduced Gesture Responsiveness**
  - Smoothing window: Increased from 5 to 10 frames
  - Less jittery, more deliberate control
  - Better rejection of accidental gestures

- **Fixed Brightness Control**
  - Threshold reduced from Â±10% to Â±5%
  - More sensitive to wrist position changes
  - Now properly detects vertical hand movement

- **Fixed Play/Pause Gesture**
  - Hold time increased from 10 to 15 frames (~0.5s)
  - Cooldown increased from 5 to 10 frames
  - Prevents continuous toggling
  - More deliberate activation required

#### Technical Changes
- `GESTURE_SMOOTHING_WINDOW`: 5 â†’ 10 frames
- Brightness threshold: Â±10% â†’ Â±5%
- Palm open detection: 10 â†’ 15 frames
- Palm closed cooldown: 5 â†’ 10 frames
- Control logic: Override â†’ Blended (70/30 split)

#### User Impact

## Phase 1 Updates (October 25, 2025)

### Major Improvements

#### 1. Enhanced Face Detection
- **Two-Stage Detection**: Face Detection (long-range) + Face Mesh (accurate distance)
- **Confidence Threshold**: Lowered to 0.3 for better long-range detection (100cm+)
- **Cropped Processing**: 20% margin expansion for better mesh detection
- Uses landmarks 234 (left face) and 454 (right face) for precise face width measurement
- More reliable detection in various lighting conditions

#### 2. Improved Distance Calculation
- Focal length updated to 700px (from 500px) for better accuracy
- Known face width set to 16cm (average human face)
- Distance range: 25cm to 400cm (4 meters)

#### 3. Optimized Control Thresholds
- **Distance change threshold: 10cm** (reduced from 15cm)
- **Stability duration: 1.5 seconds** (reduced from 3.0s)
- More responsive to user movement while maintaining stability

#### 4. Enhanced Volume Control
- Implemented **steep power curve** (exponent 0.4) for pronounced volume changes
- Volume mapping: 20% (close) to 100% (far)
- Small movements result in noticeable volume changes

#### 5. Stability Logic for Crowds
- **Grace Range**: Â±5cm (reduced from Â±10cm) to prevent micro-adjustments
- **Stability Time**: 1.5 seconds wait before updating
- **Movement Threshold**: 5cm movement resets stability timer
- Perfect for crowd scenarios where people are settling in
- Linear interpolation from 30% (close) to 100% (far)
- Removed complex multi-tier logic for better predictability
- Minimum change threshold: 2%

#### 6. Media Control Integration
- **Automatic media pause** when no face detected for 3 seconds
- **Automatic media resume** when user returns
- Uses Windows media control keys (pywin32)
- Works with most media players (YouTube, Spotify, VLC, etc.)

### Configuration Changes

**Updated Settings (`src/config/settings.py`):**
```python
# Distance thresholds
DISTANCE_CHANGE_THRESHOLD = 0.10  # 10cm
STABLE_TIME_THRESHOLD = 1.5       # 1.5 seconds

# Face detection
KNOWN_FACE_WIDTH_CM = 16.0
FOCAL_LENGTH = 700

# Distance ranges
MIN_DISTANCE_CM = 25
MAX_DETECTION_DISTANCE = 400

# Brightness mapping
BRIGHTNESS_CLOSE = 30
BRIGHTNESS_FAR = 100

# Volume mapping (steep curve)
VOLUME_CLOSE = 0.20
VOLUME_FAR = 1.0
VOLUME_DISTANCE_EXPONENT = 0.4

# Media control
ABSENCE_TIMEOUT = 3.0
PRESENCE_RESUME_DELAY = 2.0
```

### User Experience Improvements

1. **Removed console spam** - No more `[DETECTED]` messages every 2 seconds
2. **Faster response** - 1.5s stability vs 3.0s previous
3. **More sensitive** - 10cm movement triggers update vs 15cm
4. **Better volume changes** - Steep curve makes changes very noticeable
5. **Smart media control** - Pauses when you leave, resumes when you return

### Technical Details

**Brightness Calculation:**
```python
distance_normalized = (distance - 25) / (400 - 25)
brightness = 30 + (100 - 30) * distance_normalized
```

**Volume Calculation:**
```python
distance_normalized = (distance - 25) / (400 - 25)
volume_percent = 20 + 80 * (distance_normalized ** 0.4)
```

### How It Works Now

1. **Face detected** â†’ Track distance using Face Mesh landmarks
2. **Distance stable for 1.5s OR changed by Â±10cm** â†’ Update brightness/volume
3. **No face for 3 seconds** â†’ Pause media playback
4. **Face returns** â†’ Resume media playback

### Dependencies Added
- `pywin32>=305` - For Windows media control

### Files Modified
- `src/config/settings.py` - Updated thresholds and ranges
- `src/modules/perception/face_detector.py` - Switched to Face Mesh
- `src/modules/adaptation/brightness_controller.py` - Linear mapping
- `src/modules/adaptation/volume_controller.py` - Steep curve implementation

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. âœ… Move closer (50cm) â†’ Volume/brightness decrease
2. âœ… Move farther (150cm) â†’ Volume/brightness increase

4. âœ… Move 10cm+ â†’ Immediate update
